There are 2 packages in this project:

MatrixMultiply
PageRank

a) In MatrixMultiply there are 3 classes with a main method 

To run the different mains from eclipse create a run/debug
configuration for each then enter arguments for command line.

or use the jar (to create a jar file from this project do from within 
Eclipse

Right Click the project->Export Java Jar file->Enter location
and name of jar)

To run one of the mains in the jar in a machine with hadoop 
installed type

./bin/hadoop jar jarname.jar ConversionMain true input_filename output_filename false path

or 
 
./bin/hadoop jar jarname.jar OnePassMatrixMultiplyMain 2 3 2 true

or

./bin/hadoop jar jarname.jar TwoPassMatrixMultiplyMain 2 3 2 true


a.1) ConversionMain.java

This converts a file from binary to Hadoop SequenceFile or the other way
The command line arguments are

tobinary input_filename output_filename debug path

so to convert a given input_filename from binary to SequenceFile do

false input_filename output_filename false path_where_to_put_output_filename

to convert a given input_filename from SequenceFile to binary do

true input_filename output_filename false path_where_to_put_output_filename

if the path (last argument) is omitted the input and output files will be
read/written to a folder specified in the constant INPUT_PATH_FOLDER defined
at the top of ConversionMain.java
  
Note that the binary format consists of a first line with numrows numcols
then each line after that is one entry of the matrix in the order 
0 0
0 1
...
0 numcols-1
1 0
1 1
...
1 numcols-1
...
 
a.2) The arguments for OnePassMatrixMultiplyMain.java
are the dimensions
of the 2 matrices M (IxK) and N (KxJ), the number of groups and whether 
debugging should be enabled or not (if debug is on it will print out 
information along the different stages of the map reduce 
pipeline)
 
The grouping is only implemented for square matrices and additionally
the number of groups should be a multiple of the size of the square
matrices. So for 6x6 matrices use 1,2,3,6 groups (6 groups is the same
as no grouping since each group will just have one row/one column)

So the arguments for 2 groups would be

6 6 6 2 false

For non square matrices use 0 or -1 for the group argument
So enter say for the product of a 2x3 times by 3x2 matrix

2 3 2 -1 false

a.2) No grouping was implemented for the 2 pass algorithm so the
arguments for TwoPassMatrixMultiplyMain.java are just the dimensions
of the 2 matrices

2 3 2 false

for the product of a matrix 2x3 by a matrix 3x2

In both the one pass and the 2 pass algorithms the matrices are dense
i.e. none of their entries is zero.
