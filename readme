To run the different mains from eclipse create a run/debug
configuration then enter arguments for command line.

The arguments for OnePassMatrixMultiplyMain.java
and TwoPassMatrixMultiplyMain.java are the dimensions
of the 2 matrices M (IxK) and N (KxJ) and whether debugging
should be enabled or not (if debug is on it will print out 
information along the different stages of the map reduce 
pipeline)
 
So enter say for the product of a 2x3 times a 3x2 matrix

2 3 2 true

To create a jar file from this project do from within 
Eclipse

Right Click the project->Export Java Jar file->Enter location
and name of jar

To run one of the mains in the jar in a machine with hadoop 
installed type

./bin/hadoop jar jarname.jar OnePassMatrixMultiplyMain 2 3 2 true

or

./bin/hadoop jar jarname.jar TwoPassMatrixMultiplyMain 2 3 2 true
